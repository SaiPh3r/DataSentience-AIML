# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection with YOLOv11

## 🚀 Deep Learning Based Tumor Localization System  
An advanced **deep learning-based detection model** built using **YOLOv11**, designed to detect and localize **brain tumors** from MRI scan images with precision and speed.

---

## 📌 Features  
✔️ **Real-Time Object Detection:** Detects tumor regions directly in MRI images using YOLOv13.  
✔️ **High Accuracy & Speed:** Leverages cutting-edge YOLOv13 architecture for fast medical diagnostics.  
✔️ **Annotated Outputs:** Visualizes bounding boxes around tumor regions.  
✔️ **Modular Codebase:** Easy to adapt, expand, or retrain with custom datasets.  
✔️ **Clean Visuals:** Output images with detections for review or reporting.
