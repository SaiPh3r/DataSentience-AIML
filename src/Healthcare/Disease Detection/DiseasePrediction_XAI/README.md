## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is part of my contribution to the [Social Summer of Code (SSoC)](https://github.com/KavyaMunusamy/DataSentience-AIML) under the repository [DataSentience-AIML](https://github.com/KavyaMunusamy/DataSentience-AIML.git). 

I have built a **Disease Prediction Model integrated with Explainable AI (XAI)** techniques such as **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to make predictions transparent and interpretable by both users and healthcare professionals.

## 🎯 Objective

✅ Predict disease presence based on medical and demographic features.  
✅ Explain model predictions with interactive SHAP visualizations.  
✅ Provide an end-to-end **Streamlit Web App** for user interaction.

## 🔍 Features

- 🏥 **Disease Prediction** using Random Forest Classifier.
- 💡 **SHAP Explainability**: Waterfall Plot, Force Plot, and Feature Importance.
- 🌐 **Streamlit Web Application** for easy input and live explanations.
- 📊 **Model Evaluation**: Classification reports, Accuracy, F1-score.
- 🔄 Model Comparisons (RandomForest, LogisticRegression, XGBoost - optionally expandable).
