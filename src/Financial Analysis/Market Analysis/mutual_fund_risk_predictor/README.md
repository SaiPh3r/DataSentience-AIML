# 📊 Mutual Fund Risk Predictor

This project uses machine learning to predict the **risk category** (e.g., Low, High, Very High) of a mutual fund based on features like returns, NAV, AUM, and investment details.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ 1. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib
````

### 🧹 2. Preprocess the Dataset

```bash
python preprocess.py
```

* Cleans columns like `%`, `Rs.`, and `cr`
* One-hot encodes categorical features
* Drops invalid rows
* Saves cleaned output to `cleaned_data.csv`

### 🤖 3. Train the Model

```bash
python train.py
```

* Trains a `RandomForestClassifier`
* Prints a classification report
* Saves model to `models/rf_model.pkl`

### 🔮 4. Predict on New Data

```bash
python predict.py
```

* Uses a sample mutual fund dictionary as input
* Predicts and prints the fund's risk category

## 🧠 Sample Input Format

```python
sample_input = {
    "AMC": "mahindra manulife mutual fund",
    "Fund Name": "Demo Fund",
    "Morning star rating": 3,
    "Value Research rating": 4,
    "1 month return": "5.50%",
    "NAV": 25.6,
    "1 Year return": "42.50%",
    "3 Year Return": "19.20%",
    "Minimum investment": "Rs.500.0",
    "Fund Manager": "Test Manager",
    "AUM": "123.45 cr",
    "Category": "Equity"
}
```
