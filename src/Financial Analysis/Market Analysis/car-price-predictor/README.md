## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Used car pricing varies drastically based on region, features, and past usage. Buyers and sellers often struggle to evaluate a fair market price. This project uses machine learning to build a robust **price estimation model** based on actual car data.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used is `cleaned_car_data.csv`, derived from real-world car listings with noisy columns removed. It contains structured data like:

| Feature             | Description                                  |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `myear`             | Manufacturing year                           |
| `fuel`              | Fuel type (Petrol/Diesel/CNG/etc.)           |
| `transmission`      | Manual/Automatic transmission                 |

| `Drive Type`        | Front/Rear/All Wheel Drive                   |
| `Steering Type`     | Power/Manual Steering                        |
| `owner_type`        | First owner, second, etc.                    |
| `state`, `City`     | Geographical location                        |
| `listed_price`      | ðŸ”¥ Target column â€“ the price to predict      |

## ðŸ§  ML Approach

- **Model**: Random Forest Regressor
- **Preprocessing**:  
  - Imputation (median for numerical, most frequent for categorical)  
  - One-Hot Encoding for categorical columns  
- **Pipeline**: Combined preprocessor + regressor with `sklearn.Pipeline`
