## PROJECT TITLE : BIRD SPECIES CLASSIFICATION

#### AIM

To classify different species of birds using deep learning and computer vision.

#### DESCRIPTION

This is a classification problem where we classify different species of birds using a Xception Transfer Learning Model. The application provides a user-friendly Streamlit interface for real-time bird species prediction.

**‚ú® Recent Updates:**
- ‚úÖ Fixed deprecated Streamlit cache functions for better performance
- ‚úÖ Updated to modern Streamlit `@st.cache_resource` 
- ‚úÖ Enhanced UI with improved user experience
- ‚úÖ Added confidence visualization and top-3 predictions
- ‚úÖ Fixed deprecated PIL Image.ANTIALIAS usage
- ‚úÖ Added proper error handling and documentation

#### FEATURES

- ü¶Ö **400+ Bird Species Classification**
- üì± **Mobile-Responsive Interface** 
- üéØ **Real-time Predictions** with confidence scores
- üìä **Top-3 Predictions Display**
- ‚ö° **Optimized Performance** with modern caching
- üñºÔ∏è **Image Preview** before prediction

#### DEPLOYMENT

StreamLit-Share = Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes. All in Python. No front‚Äëend experience required. Streamlit‚Äôs open-source app framework is a breeze to get started with. It is very easy to use. One just have to connect with the github repo and start deploying it on streamlit share and you are good to go.

#### LIBRARIES NEEDED

1. Numpy
2. Tensorflow
3. Keras
4. Xception
5. Glob
6. StreamLit

#### CONCLUSION

We can conclude that our Web App classifies bird species with the help of Xception Tranfer Learning library.
