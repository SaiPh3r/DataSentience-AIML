# Model Information

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to classify waste images into two categories: Organic and Recyclable. The model was trained on a curated dataset containing labeled images of various waste items. Key details:

- **Architecture:** Custom CNN with multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by dense layers for classification.
- **Input Size:** Images are resized to 128x128 pixels before being fed to the model.
- **Classes:**
  - Organic: Includes food scraps, leaves, and other biodegradable materials.
  - Recyclable: Includes plastics, metals, paper, and other materials suitable for recycling.
- **Training:**
  - Data augmentation techniques were used to improve generalization.
  - The model was trained using categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.
  - Achieved high accuracy on a held-out validation set.
- **Deployment:**
  - The trained model is saved in HDF5 format (`model/model.h5`) and loaded by the Streamlit app for inference.

# Waste Classification App

A Streamlit web application that classifies waste images as either Organic or Recyclable using a deep learning model.

## Overview
Waste management is a critical issue for environmental sustainability. This project aims to assist users in correctly classifying waste as either organic or recyclable using a simple web interface powered by deep learning. The app is designed for educational, research, and practical use cases.

## Features
- Upload image functionality (drag-and-drop or file picker)
- Real-time waste classification (Organic or Recyclable)
- Support for JPG, JPEG, and PNG formats
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Fast and lightweight model for quick predictions

## How It Works
1. User uploads a waste image.
2. The app preprocesses the image and feeds it to a trained deep learning model.
3. The model predicts whether the waste is organic or recyclable.
4. The result is displayed instantly on the web interface.

## Demo
The app is deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud:
[Waste Classification App Demo](https://wasteclassification2645.streamlit.app/)

## Model Details
- The model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a dataset of waste images.
- It distinguishes between organic (e.g., food scraps, leaves) and recyclable (e.g., plastic, metal, paper) waste.
