 Movie Success Predictor
Predict whether a movie will be a box office hit or flop using machine learning based on various features like cast, director, genre, budget, and more. Built using the TMDB 5000 Movies and Credits dataset.

📊 Problem Statement
Movie studios invest millions in production and promotion. However, predicting a movie's financial success remains a challenge. This project uses machine learning to build a predictive model that classifies movies as Hit or Flop based on features like:

Budget

Cast and Crew

Genres

Popularity

Runtime

Production Companies

Keywords

📁 Dataset
Source: TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset on Kaggle

Files:

tmdb_5000_movies.csv

tmdb_5000_credits.csv

Target:

Binary label: Success → Hit (1) or Flop (0)
(based on revenue vs budget)

🧠 Model Overview
Step	Description
🧹 Preprocessing	JSON parsing, feature extraction, handling nulls
🔍 Feature Engineering	Top cast, genres, director, keywords
🧪 Model	RandomForestClassifier
🎯 Target Variable	Hit (1) if revenue >= 2 * budget, else Flop (0)
