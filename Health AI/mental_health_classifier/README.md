A machine learning-based system that detects signs of moderate to severe depression based on user-generated text inputsâ€”such as journal entries, social media posts, or questionnaire responses. The model uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify suicidal or non-suicidal content with the help of logistic regression and TF-IDF features.
